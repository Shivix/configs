# Configs
My collection of config files for a range of software I use or used to use.

## Data file
configs.lua is a consise list of configs used, available to be used as a date file for Lua scripts.

## Diffing
To see which configurations on your local machine differ from the ones in the repo you can run:
```sh
$ lua diff.lua
```

## Editting
To edit the files in Neovim's diff mode run:
```sh
$ lua edit.lua <file> # Note the file here is the path in the config without configs/
```
